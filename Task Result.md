## Used technologies / Frameworks

JavaScript.

I choose JavaScript because of my extended experience with the language and the versatility it has to obtain attractive user experiences.

I dind't use any frameworks because of the small scale of the project.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

None.

I didn't use any 3rd party libraries because the required functionalities could be easily attained with plain JavaScript, avoiding the unnecessary overweight of additional scripts.
